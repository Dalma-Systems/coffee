# Contribution of CoFFEE to DIH^2 GitHub

- The content of folder `FEATS` was a contribution to DIH^2 consortium GitHub.
- This was a condition from consortium, provide CoFFEE source code in their public repository.
- The contribution was made to [RAMP-EU FEATS](https://github.com/ramp-eu/FEATS) through [this]( ) pull request.
- The project follows the structure and standards defined in [TTE.project1](https://github.com/ramp-eu/TTE.project1)
- The folder `src` contains the broker and coffee code at the moment (2020/10/15), it is compressed just in our repository, in DIH^2 repository they are uncompressed. There is a change in the code shared, CoFFEE work order service is not calling LATTEE to schedule work orders, because LATTE is not up, we are sharing only CoFFEE. This call meanwhile was removed, because it was not respecting the architecture defined.
